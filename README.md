Besides the original work of Jakub Debski, the library contains the work of
others, as listed in [AUTHORS](AUTHORS):

  * Kusigrosz wrote the delve map generator (`rl.mapgenerators.delve`), the
    winding path generator, and the name generator (`rl.names`), which makes
    up names that sound like those it is given, a list of English names, for
    instance. All of them were placed in the public
    domain; the original descriptions are kept at the top of each module.
  * Adam Milazzo wrote the field of view algorithm (`rl.fov`).
  * illyigan wrote the terminal colours code (stc).

Demos
-----

There are two demos included with this library: a demo game and a feature
demo. Both can be built using [Xmake](https://xmake.io/):

```sh
cd demo-game
xmake config -m debug
xmake build
```

for the demo game and the following commands for the feature demo:

```sh
cd demo-feature
xmake config
xmake build
```

You can run the generated executables with `xmake run`.
